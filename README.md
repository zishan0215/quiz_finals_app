quiz_finals_app
===============

This is a quick application that i built in PHP for the quiz finals that i conducted along with my friends. We needed an application so that the quiz would be better organized. There are five finalists. Four buttons - Correct, Wrong, Pass and Pass Correct. The app automatically updates the score based on right or wrong answer
